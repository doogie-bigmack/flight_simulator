# Task ID: 2
# Title: Game Design Document Creation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive game design document outlining the core mechanics, visual style, and gameplay elements for the star collection game.
# Details:
1. Define core game mechanics (star collection)
2. Design character movement and controls suitable for 6-12 year olds
3. Create concept art for characters and environment
4. Define visual style (bright, colorful, kid-friendly)
5. Outline level progression
6. Define scoring system
7. Document multiplayer interaction mechanics
8. Create initial wireframes for UI

The document should focus on simplicity and engagement for the target age group (6-12 years).

# Test Strategy:
Review the game design document with stakeholders and potentially with a small focus group of children in the target age range. Validate that the proposed mechanics align with the objective of 90% of players playing for at least 10 minutes.
