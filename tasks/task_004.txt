# Task ID: 4
# Title: Player Character Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and implement the player character with movement controls optimized for children aged 6-12.
# Details:
1. Design and model player character(s)
2. Implement character controller with simple, intuitive controls
3. Add character animations (idle, movement, collecting stars)
4. Implement collision detection
5. Add character customization options if specified in design

Controls should be simple enough for 6-year-olds to understand. Consider using arrow keys, WASD, or single-touch/click movement for mobile platforms. Character movement should feel responsive but forgiving.

# Test Strategy:
Test character movement across different platforms. Conduct usability testing with children in the target age range to ensure controls are intuitive. Verify that collision detection works properly and character animations trigger correctly.
