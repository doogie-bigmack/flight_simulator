# Priority: high
# Description: Create and implement the player character with movement controls optimized for children aged 6-12.
# Details:
1. Design and model player character(s) - COMPLETED
2. Implement character controller with simple, intuitive controls - COMPLETED
3. Add character animations (idle, movement, collecting stars) - COMPLETED

Player character creation and movement logic have been implemented in client/main.js. The implementation includes intuitive controls suitable for the 6-12 age range, with responsive but forgiving movement mechanics.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the implemented character movement works correctly across different platforms. Review the code in client/main.js to ensure it follows best practices. Conduct usability testing with children in the target age range to confirm controls are intuitive. Verify that collision detection works properly and character animations trigger correctly.
