# Task ID: 5
# Title: Star Collection Mechanics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core star collection mechanics including star spawning, collection logic, and visual/audio feedback.
# Details:
1. Create star objects with appropriate visuals
2. Implement star spawning system (random or patterned)
3. Develop collection detection logic
4. Add visual effects for collection (particle effects, animations)
5. Implement sound effects for star collection
6. Create scoring system to track collected stars

Stars should be visually prominent and attractive. Collection should provide immediate, rewarding feedback through animations and sounds to reinforce positive gameplay.

# Test Strategy:
Test star spawning under various conditions. Verify that collection detection works reliably. Test scoring system accuracy. Conduct playtesting to ensure the collection mechanics are satisfying and the feedback is appropriate for children.
