# Task ID: 6
# Title: Multiplayer Functionality Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement multiplayer capabilities allowing children to play together in the same game environment.
# Details:
1. Research and implement appropriate networking solution
2. Create player synchronization system
3. Implement lobby or matchmaking system
4. Add player identification (names, avatars)
5. Develop star collection synchronization
6. Implement basic chat or communication system (with appropriate safety features for children)
7. Add multiplayer scoring and leaderboards

Focus on creating a safe, cooperative environment. Consider implementing friend codes or other child-safe connection methods rather than public matchmaking.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct network testing with multiple clients. Test under various network conditions including latency and packet loss. Verify that player movements and star collection synchronize correctly across all clients. Test safety features to ensure they properly protect children.
