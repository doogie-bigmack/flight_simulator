# Task ID: 7
# Title: User Interface Development
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement kid-friendly UI elements including menus, score display, and in-game information.
# Details:
1. Design main menu with bright, engaging visuals
2. Implement in-game UI for score display
3. Create multiplayer lobby/room UI
4. Add settings menu with age-appropriate options
5. Implement tutorial or help screens
6. Design and implement feedback animations and notifications

UI should use large, readable text and intuitive icons. Minimize text for younger players who may not read well. Use color coding and symbols where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct usability testing with children in the target age range. Verify that UI elements are understandable without reading. Test UI scaling across different screen sizes and resolutions. Ensure all interactive elements are easily clickable/tappable for children with developing motor skills.
